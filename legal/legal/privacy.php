            <strong>Your Privacy and AFS Interculture South Africa</strong>
            <br>
            AFS Interculture South Africa is committed to upholding the confidentiality 
            and security of your personal information. The information below explains 
            what we do with the data we collect and applies to information submitted 
            anywhere on this site.
            <br><br>

            <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
            <br>
            AFS Interculture South Africa collects information voluntarily provided to us 
            through this site. AFS Interculture South Africa does not collect personally 
            identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and 
            knowingly provided by such individuals.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Cookies</strong>
            <br>
            AFS Interculture South Africa does utilise cookies. A “cookie” is a small 
            piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user’s web browser while 
            the user is browsing that website. This information helps AFS to know how and 
            when our site is visited and which pages are viewed.
            <br><br>

            Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a 
            user’s prior visit/s to our website. This means that you might see an AFS 
            Interculture South Africa ad when browsing the internet because you visited 
            our site.
            <br><br>

            We use non-personally identifiable information collected through a “cookie” 
            to improve the design and content of our site, to enable us to personalise 
            your Internet experience, analyse trends, gather broad demographic information, 
            administer the site, and for other AFS purposes.
            <br><br>

            Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google 
            advertising opt-out page.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Security</strong>
            <br>
            AFS Interculture South Africa will not sell, rent, share, trade or give 
            away any personally identifiable information to any third parties outside 
            our partner organisations and those working directly with them in connection 
            with AFS activities. We will only disclose personally identifiable 
            information we maintain to those not directly working in connection with 
            AFS activities when required to do so by law, for example, in response to 
            a court order or a subpoena.
            <br><br>

            Personal information collected by AFS Interculture South Africa and our 
            websites is stored in secure operating environments and can only be accessed 
            by AFS Interculture South Africa employees, consultants, or volunteers 
            exclusively for the management of the AFS Interculture South Africa programme 
            operations. At present, we centralise records of personal information in 
            the United States of America and in Thailand. Therefore, we may transfer your 
            personal information to other countries, including but not limited to the 
            United States of America and Thailand, and may perform some of our data 
            processing of your personal information outside your country of residence. 
            The transfer and processing of your information may be governed by the laws 
            of the United States of America, Thailand, or another jurisdiction, which 
            may not offer the same rights and remedies as the laws in your country of 
            residence. AFS will protect your personal information no matter where we 
            process or store it, following this privacy statement. By submitting your personal 
            data to AFS, you hereby consent to this transfer and processing of your 
            personal information.

            <br>
            Find an AFSer is intended to help members of the AFS family find each other. 
            We ask that you use good judgment and discretion when sending messages to other 
            members on the list. Please do not use information found here for the purpose 
            of commercial promotion of any kind. AFS does not bear any responsibility for

            All registrations are voluntary. The only individuals listed in Find an AFSer 
            are those who have registered themselves here. AFS does not add individuals to 
            the database, therefore if you do not find your AFS friend in “Find a Friend” 
            it is because they have not registered themselves.
            <br><br>

            Find an AFSer section of our site allows you to post your name, e-mail address 
            and other information permitting AFS friends and families to contact you. You 
            may at your own discretion delete, update or correct this information at any time 
            by going into your entry and logging on with your User ID (your e-mail address) 
            and with the password you selected.
            <br><br>

            Please remember that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable 
            information (such as your first and last name, e-mail address etc.) in Find an 
            AFSer that information can be collected and used by others and may result in 
            unsolicited messages from other posters or third party entities. AFS is not 
            responsible for who may contact you by using this information. AFS RECOMMENDS 
            THAT YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AND HOME ADDRESS USING 
            Find An AFSer.
